### What I Learned

-how to add CSS variables -> create variables using :root as the CSS selector
-the syntax for CSS variables -> add '--' Example: --spacing
-how to make a range slider work to update variables
-dataset objects: that you can create dataset objects that you can manipulate by using "data-[whatever]" = 'whatever' (used in this exercise to add 'px' to the input variable)
